description: <p style="text-align: justify">Sleek, minimalistic tablet mount designed for standard EU electrical wall installation boxes. Magnetic docking makes mounting effortless, giving your tablet a clean, floating look with less than a 5 mm gap from the wallâ€”without blocking buttons or speakers.<br><br> The mount includes a custom power supply that fits neatly into the flush installation box and is managed by an ESP32-C3 running ESPHome firmware. This enables smart charging control and optional LEDs for status indication or night light. It integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant and can also function as a Bluetooth proxy or host additional peripherals, such as presence or temperature sensors.</p>
