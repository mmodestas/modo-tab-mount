## Holder {#holder}
The holder is mounted on the wall and provides the main docking area for the tablet. It includes cutouts for ventilation and alignment, ensuring stability while keeping buttons and speakers unblocked.

## Metal Plate {#metal-plate}
A thin steel plate attaches to the back of the tablet with adhesive. This plate connects
magnetically to the holder, giving the tablet a floating look and allowing easy docking
and removal.

---

## Power Supply {#power-supply}
A custom power supply fits inside the standard EU wall box. Controlled by an ESP32-C3
microcontroller running ESPHome, it enables smart charging control and integration
with Home Assistant.

---

## Flat USB Cable {#flat-usb-cable}
A flat USB cable runs from the power supply to the tablet, hidden neatly along the wall
or behind the holder. It ensures reliable charging without compromising the slim design.

---

## Optional LEDs {#optional-leds}
The design supports WS2812 or similar LED strips, surrounding the mount. These can be
used for status indication, notifications, or ambient night lighting — all controlled
through Home Assistant.
