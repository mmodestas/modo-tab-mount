## About {#about}

Sleek, minimalistic tablet mount designed for standard EU electrical wall installation boxes. Magnetic docking makes mounting effortless, giving your tablet a clean, floating look with less than a 5 mm gap from the wall—without blocking buttons or speakers.

The mount includes a custom power supply that fits neatly into the flush installation box and is managed by an ESP32-C3 running ESPHome firmware. This enables smart charging control and optional LEDs for status indication or night light. It integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant and can also function as a Bluetooth proxy or host additional peripherals, such as presence or temperature sensors.

## Holder {#holder}
The holder is mounted on the wall and provides the main docking area for the tablet. It includes cutouts for ventilation and alignment, ensuring stability while keeping buttons and speakers unblocked.
