Other elements of the mounting plate:
- Magnets: 12 small 5x5x5 mm neodymium N52 grade magnets with a hidden iron ring for secure magnetic attachment.
- Pads: 4 round silicone pads reduce friction and prevent scratches on the tablet.

## Tablet Plate
A 3 mm thick iron plate with a 42 mm diameter is attached to the back of the tablet using 3M VHB double-sided ultra-strong tape.
This enables a secure magnetic connection between the tablet and the mounting plate.

## USB Cable
A custom thin, flat USB Type-C cable connects the power supply to the tablet.
- Designed to fit neatly in the gap between the wall and tablet
- Mounting plate cutouts ensure proper cable routing without pinching or bending

# Power Supply
A custom power supply fits inside the standard EU wall box.

through Home Assistant.
